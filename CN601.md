## ðŸ”§ Notes for ODE Development

- Pins 3â€“10 (D0â€“D7): Classic 8-bit IDE data bus, bidirectional. You must tristate correctly when not driving.
- Pins 12 & 13 (A0/A1): Select between command registers (ATAPI command block).
- Pins 14 & 15: Define read/write cycles; your FPGA or MCU must respond with correct timing.
- Pin 16 (INTRQ): Asserted when drive has data/command ready (DMA/PIO use this).
- Pin 20: +5V power line; ensure itâ€™s isolated or protected in ODE mode.
