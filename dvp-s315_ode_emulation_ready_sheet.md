# Emulation Ready Sheet ‚Äì Sony DVP-S315 ODE Interface (CN601)

> üéØ This document lists all known memory-mapped registers and address lines that are routed through connector **CN601**, which connects the mainboard to the original DVD drive. These registers must be emulated or handled properly to ensure compatibility with an SSD-based ODE replacement.

---

## üì¶ Primary Interface: ATAPI (IDE) Bus

The DVD drive is connected to the SH7034 via a parallel IDE (ATAPI) interface routed through CN601. It uses a memory-mapped register block starting at:

```text
Base Address: 0xFFFFEC00
```

This block includes:

- ATAPI command register (0xFFFFEC07)
- Data buffer (0xFFFFEC00)
- Status & control (0xFFFFEC07, 0xFFFFEC08)
- Signature bytes for ATAPI detection (0xFFFFEC04/05 = 0x14 / 0xEB)

‚úÖ Must be fully emulated.

## üì° Drive Presence Detection & Servo Control (likely routed via CN601)

Additional CN601 lines are likely used for signaling:

| Line          | Purpose                | Notes for ODE                                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `DRV_IN`      | Drive inserted / ready | Should be tied HIGH or software-simulated         |
| `SLED_HOME`   | Sled position sensor   | May need to simulate home position                |
| `DISC_DETECT` | Optical disc present   | Affects TEST UNIT READY & STATUS                  |
| `SERVO_ACK`   | Servo ready signal     | Optional, but likely polled                       |
| `SPDL_OK`     | Spindle motor status   | Must simulate disc spin-up if firmware polls      |
| `RESET_DRV`   | Drive-side reset line  | Handle as edge-triggered reset for emulated logic |

‚èπÔ∏è Some of these lines may go through the ICS604 (Servo Controller), and appear on CN601 as digital control/status lines.

## üîß Other Memory-Mapped Addresses (Not on CN601)

These do **not** go through CN601, but are useful to simulate drive status during boot:

| Address      | Description              | Use in Emulation                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `0xFFFFD010` | SH7034 GPIO Port Control | Can be used for RESET or Drive Select lines |
| `0xFFFFFEC0` | Interrupt Mask Register  | Optional, for full IRQ compliance           |
| `0xFFFFFEE0` | DMA / Bus Arbitration    | May be monitored, not critical              |

## ‚úÖ Summary: Signals Required for ODE Compatibility

| Category      | Required?   | Emulate?            | Notes                                      |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ATAPI Regset  | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes              | Must fully implement ATAPI PIO I/O         |
| IDE Handshake | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes              | BSY, DRQ, INTRQ must follow timing         |
| SENSE/STATUS  | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes              | Must provide correct codes                 |
| SLED/SPDL OK  | ‚ùå Optional | ‚ö†Ô∏è Yes (simulate) | Needed if firmware checks mechanical state |
| GPIO          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe  | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial        | Depends on drive model                     |
| IRQ Support   | ‚ùå No       | ‚ùå No               | Firmware uses polling, not interrupts      |
