## Functional Highlights

- LDMT±: Controls the tray-loading motor. Driven via IC361 (BA5912) which is PWM-controlled by the gate array (IC804).
- CHUCK_SW / TRAY_SW: Optical sensors (PH001) report position states to the system controller.
- TRAY FREE: Actively floats the motor drive outputs when logic goes high; crucial for mechanical decoupling.
- OUT± and BIAS: Drive and bias tilt mechanism. These are analog lines and relevant if simulating disc positioning during emulation.
- OPN/CLS IN: PWM signal encoding 3 states: Open (H), Stop (Hi-Z), Close (L).
